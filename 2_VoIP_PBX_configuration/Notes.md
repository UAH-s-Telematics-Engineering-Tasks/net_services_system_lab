# Notes on future problems...
1. Asterisk Contexts group several users together. Users belonging to a context may communicate with users within the same one but the cannot do so with users belonging to a different context. If a context A contains a context B users from A will be able to call users from B but the opposite is **NOT** true!
2. Don't despair when installing ODBC for DB Connections...
3. You have a GitHub page containing the necessary tables for the MySQL DBs so that Asterisk can communicate with MariaDB and the like.
