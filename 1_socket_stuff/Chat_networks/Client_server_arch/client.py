#                              How cool are ANSI Escape Sequences?                          #
# ANSI Escape Sequences are, as their name implies, special sequences that we can print     #
# to a terminal to control its behavior instead of showing characters on screen. You can    #
# find a very comprehensive table over at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code.   #
# We have used the following sequences which can be found in the aforementioned site:       #
#           ESC[nF -> Move the cursor to the beginning of the line n lines up               #
#           ESC[nG -> Move the cursor to column n in the current line                       #
#           ESC[2K -> Erase the entire line without changing the cursorÂ¡s position          #
# Note the ESC character is given by 0x1B or 27 as seen in the ASCII table, that's why      #
# you see the leading \x1B in these sequences. Tradition has it that we use the octal       #
# equivalent, \033, but we are more of the "hexy" kind... Combining these escape sequences  #
# with the program flow we have amanged to build a more visually appealing CLI for our chat #
# client but it's still not as robust as we would like it to be...                          #
