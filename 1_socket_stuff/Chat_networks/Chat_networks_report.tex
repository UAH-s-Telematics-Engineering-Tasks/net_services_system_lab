#                                  Closing sockets and the TIME_WAIT interval                                    #
# As seen in https://serverfault.com/questions/329845/how-to-forcibly-close-a-socket-in-time-wait and in         #
# RFC 793 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793), when closing a TCP socket it will remain "open" long             #
# enough to guarantee the FIN ACK segment has reached the opposite end. If we close the clients then             #
# the random port they've reserved will be held for some time. As clients are not binded to a specific port      #
# this will have no impact whatsoever when launching new clients, they'll just get a new port number and life    #
# will seamlessly go on. If we manually close the server however the port we had binded it to will continue      #
# to be used for TIME_WAIT seconds... We can check that by running netstat and looking at the top of the         #
# output. Lazy people like me would instead run netstat | head -n 20 and get away with it. We can configure      #
# this TIME_WAIT to be 0. I'm not sure whether that's done on form python on the socket or from the OS on the    #
# network manager... Anyway we should not forget it's there and that, even if we shut down our sockets correctly #
# we will have an inherent delay due to how TCP works... When we close every client gracefully and end up        #
# shutting the server down we won't experience this behaviour as the server is only left with the "listening"    #
# socket, there are NO connections open so there is no need to wait for them to receive the final message!       #

# In order to allow connections from the outside we must bind the server to every interface or, at least the one #
# providing connectivity to the outside world. If we only bind to that "outwards" interface we won't be able to  #
# connect local clients... We can then choose to bind to '' instead of '127.0.0.1' which is interpreted as       #
# INADDR_ANY by Pyhton, that is, we'll bind the server to EVERY interface                                        #

#                              How cool are ANSI Escape Sequences?                          #
# ANSI Escape Sequences are, as their name implies, special sequences that we can print     #
# to a terminal to control its behavior instead of showing characters on screen. You can    #
# find a very comprehensive table over at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code.   #
# We have used the following sequences which can be found in the aforementioned site:       #
#           ESC[nF -> Move the cursor to the beginning of the line n lines up               #
#           ESC[nG -> Move the cursor to column n in the current line                       #
#           ESC[2K -> Erase the entire line without changing the cursorÂ¡s position          #
# Note the ESC character is given by 0x1B or 27 as seen in the ASCII table, that's why      #
# you see the leading \x1B in these sequences. Tradition has it that we use the octal       #
# equivalent, \033, but we are more of the "hexy" kind... Combining these escape sequences  #
# with the program flow we have amanged to build a more visually appealing CLI for our chat #
# client but it's still not as robust as we would like it to be...                          #
