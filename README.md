# Network and Systems Lab
This repository contains several branches related to the different tasks we've had to carry out during the Network and Systems course over at the *Universidad de Alcal√°* in Madrid, Spain. These have been made by *Pablo Collado Soto* and he knows he could have done a way better job but hey, life's life isn't it?

**NOTE:** The license found in this `master` branch is applicable to every other branch. We have decided not to include it in every branch so as not to mess things up!
